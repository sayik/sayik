## üñ•Ô∏è Technology and Social Good üåü

Technology has always been a big part of my life, and I've always been fascinated by modern, innovative ideas. I believe creativity is the highest form of expression. This belief drives my journey into the world of technology.

I see technology as a way to explore endless opportunities. Combining creativity with software development feels natural to me. I want to create tools and solutions that help people and communities grow and achieve more.

This is my honest attempt to blend innovation and creativity, making a positive impact and accessing the exciting world of technology.

This is my [Dharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma)).
